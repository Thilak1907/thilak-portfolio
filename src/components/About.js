            <h3>Pre-final Year Student at Rajalakshmi Engineering College</h3>
            <p>
              I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, 
              with a passion for developing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between 
              technology and real-world applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              My academic journey has equipped me with strong foundations in AI/ML, software development,
              and problem-solving. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn and grow,
              particularly in areas like deep learning, computer vision, and web development.
